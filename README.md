# Capstone Question-Driven Development Projects (capstone-qdd-projects)

Welcome to the ****Capstone Question-Driven Development Projects**** repository. This repository is a collection of capstone software projects for different areas of software engineering, developed using the Question-Driven Development (QDD) approach.

## Importance of Capstone Projects

Capstone projects are an integral part of learning a new language or framework. They provide a practical, hands-on experience that allows learners to apply the knowledge and skills they've acquired. By working on a capstone project, learners can:

- Understand the real-world applications of the language/framework.
- Gain insights into the demands and responsibilities of the working world.
- Enhance their problem-solving and debugging skills.
- Showcase their proficiency in the language/framework.

## Question-Driven Development (QDD)

QDD is a learning approach where you focus on solving specific problems as they arise, rather than reading extensive documentation or books upfront. It involves:

- **Problem-Solution Focus**: Starting by asking questions based on immediate problems encountered during development.
- **Learning by Doing**: Spending most of the time coding and solving small, isolated problems, which helps avoid information overload.
- **Iterative Improvement**: Expecting to write, delete, and rewrite code frequently as learners refine their understanding.
- **Debugging Practice**: Enhancing debugging skills and overall development proficiency through constant troubleshooting.

By using QDD, learners can facilitate and accelerate the process of learning a new language/framework. It provides a more engaging and effective learning experience, making it an excellent approach for developing capstone projects.
